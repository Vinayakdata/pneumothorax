Pneumothorax is problem related to lungs. So for better analysis and segementation.I have proposed PneumoNET for precise detection of Penumothrorax using Machine Learning,
Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.
Techniques Used :
--> Autoencoders
--> CNN Architectures
--> Neural Activation
--> Maximum Equity Function Value
